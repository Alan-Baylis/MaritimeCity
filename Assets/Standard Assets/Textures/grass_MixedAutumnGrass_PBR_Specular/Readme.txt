Now, on to the meat of this Read-Me file.


Your texture download will include the targa image files of the texture you chose to download - the map type naming convention can be found at the end of the file name.

_alb = Albedo map
_mask = Mask map
_ao = Ambient Occlusion map

_d = Diffuse map
_s = Specular map
_g = Gloss map
_n = Normal Map
_nY+ = Normal Map with y+ (An inverted green channel, works best with UDK, 3DS Max)
_t = Transparency Map
_h = Height Map
_e = Emissive Map
_p = Only on Decal images, this is the preview image of what the decal looks like on a transparent background.
_r = Reflection Mask, to be used if your scene has a cube-map, or other reflective objects or properties.


_d1, _d2, _d3, etc. =  on more than a handfull of our textures we've been so bold as to include some alternative diffuse maps in different colors and styles. 


As always, 

Stay safe and keep your head down! 



Much Love,
